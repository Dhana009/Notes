    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** means **\"many forms.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It is an object-oriented programming concept where the same method name can exist in different classes with different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - In polymorphism, objects of different classes can respond to the same method call in their own way. This allows us to write more flexible, maintainable, and scalable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Key Benefits:\n",
    "Improves code maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports easier debugging and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourages reusability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhances readability by avoiding repetitive method names.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "🔒 Access Modifiers Clarification (Bonus):\n",
    "While not directly related to polymorphism, you mentioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "private – accessible only within the class\n",

    "protected – accessible within the class and its subclasses\n",

    "- Promotes **code reusability**\n",
    "- Reduces **boilerplate code** (like WebDriver setup, teardown, logging)\n",
    "- Encourages **modular test automation frameworks**\n",
