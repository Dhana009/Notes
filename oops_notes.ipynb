    "Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to **respond to the same method in different ways**. It literally means **\"many forms\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ **Why it's used:**  \n",
    "- To allow **dynamic behavior** during runtime.  \n",
    "- To promote **code extensibility and flexibility**.  \n",
    "- To simplify **interface usage** across different object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **Advantages:**  \n",
    "- Increases **code reusability** through method overriding and overloading.  \n",
    "- Reduces complexity by allowing **a common interface**.  \n",
    "- Supports **runtime flexibility**.  \n",
    "- Enhances **maintainability** and **scalability**.\n",

    "### üí° **Interview Statement:**  \n",
    "‚ÄúPolymorphism enables the same interface to behave differently based on the object, allowing cleaner code with minimal condition checks and enhanced flexibility.‚Äù\n",

    "> \"In encapsulation, we bind the data (variables) and class functions into a single unit called a class. We restrict direct access to the methods and attributes from outside the class. This ensures that sensitive data is handled securely and prevents it from being accidentally modified or exposed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example you gave (refined):**  \n",

    "### ‚úÖ **2. Abstraction (Your Version, Polished)**  \n",

This is usually resolved at runtime, and it helps reduce complexity by allowing a common method name to behave differently based on the class that‚Äôs using it.\"\n",
